Toy Story,Quinoa1984,"Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen. The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer. The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen. The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year). Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with.",13 February 2000,10
Toy Story,alexkolokotronis,"Toy Story is the film that started Pixar Animated Studios into its long string of never ending success. What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the film and its characters.",3 February 2009,10
Toy Story,SmileysWorld,"Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library.",30 December 2005,9
Toy Story,slokes,"Toy story was a fun, imaginative renewal of the animated genre already when it was released in 1995. It continues to be one of the epic children's movies. Behind several of the voices are well-known actor, such as Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles. That said, personally I have no affection for real-life, callous trophy hunters like R. Lee Ermey, which is playing the role of the sergeant.",10 May 2004,8
Toy Story,Lady_Targaryen,"When Toy Story came, in 1995,I was 9 years old and it was a remarkable animation;Pixar wasn't famous like today, and we didn't have movies like Shrek and Finding Nemo. But I have to say that even in the present days this movie is awesome and has great graphics. Only to start, the story: The toys have life of their own, and every time we humans are distant from them, they have their lives and their own plans. Woody, until Buzz LightYear comes up,was Andy's favorite toy and also the leader of all of them. Jealous of Buzz's fame, Woody tries to get a rid of him, and because of that is totally ignored by the others toys, who once were his friends and admired him. Looking what he did, Woody goes search Buzz and them many adventures happen.",10 November 2005,7
Toy Story,josephbartley,A great movie turned into a franchise the tales of Woody and Buzz. This move will never get old and hopefully be shown to all generations of children it will keep the little ones occupied for a while and most adults. I have watch this many of times and it never fails to bring back happy childhood memories. It show that you should never give up on any problems that may occur also a good inspiration/lesson for the kids it will show them never to give up. Personally i will be showing this movie franchise to my children a heartwarming way to spend a couple of hours with the family.,19 July 2018,8
Finding Nemo ,Coventry,"I'll be totally honest and confirm to you that everything what they say about this movie is true. It's a brilliantly animated masterpiece with lots of humor that actually works and a plot that really brings tears to your eyes from time to time. The modern artists of Pixar never cease to amaze the audience in expanding their horizons. Finding Nemo is visually stunning and you can have nothing but respect for the people who created it. I was more or less skeptic about watching it, because it was so overhyped ! Two days before it got released in my country, the TV and press loudly announced that the DVD broke all records in the USA during its first release-day. That's usually a sign of being typically mainstream and fake...but Finding Nemo is not. I'm allergic to fake sentiment and pathetic feel-good movies but I was really touched by this one. The moral and valuable life lessons are always present, but they're not shoved down your throat or thrown in your face all the time. This movie really relativates itself and that's important for a good comedy. And it's hilarious !!! Every side character in Finding Nemo (and there are a LOT of them) is exceptional and worth a mention. And the voices are cast perfectly as well...like the voice of Willem Dafoe for Gill, for example...a perfect choice. The character of Dory ( speaks through the voice of Ellen DeGeneres ) steals the show. She's an adorable blue fish who suffers from amnesia. She forgets what she's doing or going to every five minutes and that really leads to hilarious situations. Movies like this aren't just being made for children exclusive... They're good for everyone to realize you have to entertain yourself from time to time and just to enjoy the little things in life. I recommend this to everyone in the world. No matter if you're 9 or 99 years old, Finding Nemo will bring a smile on your face and leave behind a warm feeling in your heart.",10 December 2003,8
Finding Nemo ,MidtownBettie,"The character ""Dory"" was depicted with symptoms of early-stage Alzheimer Disease. That is heartbreaking, not amusing or entertaining. Yet another sign of some deep, sinister perversity in the Disney organisation. Every time I go to a Disney movie, I do so in a state of innocent anticipation, and every time I'm bitten by their warped morality. The Lion King was another case in point. The fact that these things are aimed at children and vetted approvingly by parents who seem oblivious to the underlying theme forces one really to consider to what extent movies like this are a reflection of the values of modern Western society, - or whether they work to bring about those values. Either way, I would be less frightened of the future if they where more frequently subjected to the accusatory criticism they deserve.",4 August 2003,3
Finding Nemo ,shani_dayo,"I will not say this film was excellent, and I will not say it was plain awful either. It was somewhere in the middle for Me, it is a cute family film if You have Young kids, but it is missing something. The beginning is everything, it can make or break a film, now the start to finding Nemo set the tone for the movie and served it's purpose well. The movie had nice points but at times became boring and seemed to drag on, leaving Me wishing that I could skip on to the good parts. Basically this Male clownfish has a wife in the beginning with dozens of newborn eggs who will develop into little fish, a large creature comes attacks the family, knocks Him out, kills His wife, and all of His eggs but one, Nemo His Son who He will become protective off. Then We see how Nemo becomes a energetic but hardheaded child and get's into trouble, even landing Him in a situation were He is taken by Man and dropped in a fish tank. His Dad searches for Him like any parent would, and He runs into a few new friends on the way, including an unintelligent Female fish named Dori. After this, a bunch of foolishness they find the kid and the end...yay? Anyway the movie is short of heartfelt and emotional, just simply to keep Your 5-8 year old kid's attention. It can teach You to keep going in life though, I will give it that. I have seen better, but then again I have also seen worse. It is a pretty simple non-complex storyline that is easy to follow, but doesn't leave You with anything to think about. I have high standers for Kid's film actually, I believe they should be given quality movies and life lessons because they are our youth and the future, not just any mindless old thing. It's okay to have a comedy once in a while that is funny hahaha, but this movie just isn't it and leaves a lot to be desired. It is just plain flat and stale for Me, in no way a classic, or something I will remember for years to come. I would say let Your little kids watch the movie, older ones may not enjoy it.",6 September 2015,6
"Monsters, Inc.",astutekitty,"Pixar is the best! Of them all, Monsters, Inc. takes the cake. The realism of the characters' movements & feelings is perfect. The ending is a tear jerker on a happy note. At first I was concerned with the plot of monsters scaring children with a ""business as usual"" attitude, but right away you discover that the monsters are as terrified of the kids as the kids are of monsters.... wonderful juxtaposition throughout the film... a totally enjoyable, feel-good story. Buy it for the kids and let them watch it over and over. (adults may want to sit-in on more than one occasion themselves). Personal Note: For me, a mystery about this film was ""Roz""; the voice reminded me so strongly of the grandmother in ""Dinosaurs"", and I thought the character drawing was similar as well; upon researching the two, I found they are definitely different actors.",16 January 2005,10
"Monsters, Inc.",sati_84,"I only watched it on DVD, but I wish I was at the theater, when Monsters, Inc. was released. Anyway, I was blown away. Sometimes I was rolling on the ground while laughing, sometimes I couldn't hold back my tears. Simply amazing, marvellous filmmaking. The animation is picture-perfect, the dialogue is brilliant, the story is truly original. Pixar's finest, I think, it's way better than Finding Nemo. A cinematic masterpiece, which is full of emotions and laughter. If you haven't seen it yet, then GO, RENT IT! You won't be disappointed, I guarantee it. Boo is the cutest animation movie character EVER.",24 April 2004,10
"Monsters, Inc.",steviemitchell,"I'm surprised to see this in the top 150. I didn't think the story flowed very well, the characters aren't as fleshed out as other recent animated/cgi romps (Toy Story 1 & 2, Iron Giant). And compared to some of the wonderous Japanese Anime around, such as Princess Mononoke, My Neighbour Totoro and Spirited Away, it seriously lacks emotion. It didn't hold my attention well either. The little girl is cute though!",5 August 2003,5
"Monsters, Inc.",kadler,"This movie didn't do anything right; the comedy was bad, the characters were completely undeveloped, and the story was just plain uninteresting and unintelligent. This film even failed visually with mediocre scenery. I thought it was a given that Disney would somehow manage to do something right after 2 years of sub par releases. I was wrong. This ain't no Toy Story 2 or Shrek. Safe your money for Harry Potter.",6 November 2001,1
"Monsters, Inc.",WordtwisterMN,"This movie is often compared to Shrek. I found no comparisons but for the main character and the animated look. This movie offers a story line spread so thinly that it tore within the first 30 minutes. I didn't laugh once in the first hour before I decided to get up and write how boring this movie is. The little girl is cute, but offers no surprises, and has very little attitude for supposedly a scary presence. The monsters remind me of the blue-collar characters from the row houses of Baltimore. The viewer is not allowed any kind of reference to any of the monsters past or their future. The entire movie is predictable, boring and difficult to watch. You will not likely run across anyone that says they have watched this movie multiple times as they did with Shrek. I give it a 2 of 10, and advise anyone that expects to see anything mythical, creative, or enchanting to avoid this movie.",27 November 2002,2
"Monsters, Inc.",lisaculbertson,"I was truly disappointed. I expected to find the humor that was in Shrek. I found myself looking at my watch. My older daughter fell asleep. The animation was great but I found the story and humor lacking. This is not one that I will purchase for video. When I walked out of Shrek, I couldn't wait for it to come out on video.",4 November 2001,3
