       " '************* spoilers below ************* night mother is the story of jesse sissy spacek a divorced epileptic woman who calmly announces to her brash mother anne bancroft that shes going to commit suicide this is a fascinating premise that is drained of all vitality and excitement the brilliant hook turns out to be a cheat  the story that follows is lacking in substance gravity and revelatory value where are the shocks and surprises as mother and daughter have what may be the last conversation of their lives where are the secrets revealed the confessions and fantasies and regrets theyre here but theyve all been painted the same dull color that keeps emotion in the background and celebrates the genius of playwright marsha norman at the expense of everything else the result is not a film but an exhausting endurance test let me preface my comments by saying i find sissy spacek to be one of the greatest actresses in the history of motion pictures a woman so magnetic so natural that she continues to surprise and amaze me after twenty years of stardom she brings a touch of class and magic to everything she does and ive seen her rescue more than one film from the recycling bin with her angelic face and vulnerable eyes her soft voice and sweet smile it was because of the great spacek that i watched this film in the first place and for one of her movies to be terrible it has to fail in a significant way this film fails in two first and foremost the film is adapted so faithfully from the pulitzer winning stage play that it is claustrophobic and repetitive the entire movie is a two woman dialogue between jesse and her mother what worked on stage  a middle aged mother and daughter argue for two hours in small house  dies on film a play no matter how great needs to be *adapted* for the screen\\x85 it is self indulgent and arrogant to believe that the dialogue is so perfect that not of a word of it can be altered the screenplay for this film could have been shortened by thirty to forty pages and a knowing screenwriter would have given the brilliant spacek and competent bancroft some *physical* sequences some facial reactions something to break up the wall to wall yak fest and prison like single set it is no wonder that the screenplay was adapted by the original playwright marsha norman who may know theater but reveals herself here to be clueless in film i cannot over emphasize the effect the stage play script has on the film watching jesse and her mother argue about jesses impending suicide is redundant and dull the women walk from the living room into the kitchen into the den and back into the living room where they start all over again a tiny midwestern house is not the ideal location for a single set film and the director never tries anything clever or original never tries to break up the monotony with an exterior shot or cutaway or a flashback or *anything* theres no music no other characters no other stories just two women covering the couch cushions and arguing their opinions the reverence given to the play is sickening\\x85 even shakespeares most solemn classics get shaken up for the screen the commitment to the original play seems almost spiteful\\x85 its as if the film was made only to document the dramatic treasure that was the stage play with the audience an afterthought the other reason the film fails is anne bancroft she may be a good stage actress but on film  where presence is 80% of performance  she rarely seems to fit she certainly doesnt fit here playing a midwestern grandmother but looking more like mrs robinson before her morning coffee she chases jesse around the house looking more aggravated than astounded and seems extraordinarily unsympathetic even when her lines convey a loving  if flawed  woman sissy spacek is great as she always is honest and open and so good that you actually understand and agree with her characters choice sissy lets us see that jesse is a flat tire a wrong turn of a woman who has had every bad break and made too many wrong choices shes never had control of her life and her suicide will be her way of finally saying no more  this is where i get off thats how she puts it anyway and when spacek speaks\\x85 you listen she proves in all her films that a good actress doesnt have to behave like a man doesnt have to be all bluff and bravado and borrowed testosterone in this and in films like coal miners daughter she quietly demonstrates a soft strength and quiet depth that is as impressive as it is hypnotic\\x85 you cant help but fall in love thats why it was so hard for me to watch night mother spacek is wasted in a stilted stunt of a film that never serves to engage or even distract i would not recommend this movie to anyone except die hard fans of sissy like myself and even then youll be disappointed i do give the film an entire letter grade bonus for the ending which is courageous enough to let the lead character do whats right for *her* and not pander to a hackneyed happy ending grade c',\n",

out all the various cameo appearances co writer co producer tom fontana and his pals pack the goings on with friends and favorites from other shows as well as real baltimore personages thats on top of the returns of virtually all the members of the televisions show varied casts your old favorites as well as later non favorites there was always a tug of war pitting quality conscious executive producer barry levinson fontana james yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budget conscious nbc execs who simply wanted a another moronic police procedural like nash bridges which regularly beat homicide in the ratings the pressure told as the show bounced between riveting realism that transcended its form and sleazy sensationalism that demeaned it unfortunately for this movie fontana co writers yoshimura and eric overmeyer and director jean de segonzac simply threw in the towel they took the most ludicrous story are from the series topped it with an unlikely and artistically unfruitful new plot line and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast members briefly some time has passed since the last episode of the show the former heart of baltimores homicide unit yaphet kotto as lt al giardello is now a kurt schmoke like candidate for mayor and schmoke himself makes a cameo appearance but this promising start immediately and improbably takes a tragic turn the spotlight shifts to giancarlo esposito as giardellos son mike a handsome man who has done good work elsewhere esposito was one of the pretty faces brought in late to supposedly enliven the tv series but the question for viewers always was is mike that uncomfortable as gees son or is esposito that uncomfortable in the role to be fair esposito doesnt get a chance to play out the main story without interruption thats because the writers choose this moment to revive another storyline that spat on the intelligence of the shows loyal voters an apparent snuff streaming video was promoted and then seemed to actually take place on the internet after some red herrings the detectives arrested a repellent suspect but zaljko ivaneks harassed and overworked deputy states attorney forgot to file motions in time and the suspect was released only to be murdered later lets summarize he forgot to file the paperwork because it wasnt the most sensational case of his career because the mayor the attorney general the governor the entire maryland legislature the us attorney general nbc court tv the bbc ap reuters people the sun the washington post the new york times the la times time magazine the times of london the economist the johannesburg mail and guardian losservatore romano le figaro paris match lequipe and computer world werent calling every 10 minutes to ask about the status of the case nevertheless the old gang of detectives and associates flocks back to baltimore to help out theres quite an array of talent on display unfortunately with the limited amount of dialogue to hand out some of them are merely on display two of the strongest actors clark johnson and melissa leo are criminally underused while time wasted on jon seda and michael michelle could be better spent on commercials the writers do seem to satirize this presenting jason priestley as the latest big deal detective on the other hand they give easy come easy go michelle forbes a very affecting scene theres some other sly casting with actual lt gary daddario the center of the book that gave rise to the show playing another detective guests drop in from other shows like whitney allen doing her deadpan and clueless miss sally from the childrens show beloved by the inmates on fontanas oz dina napoli of wbal tv turns up as herself  even when entertaining though these guests can be distracting ed begley jr actually advances the story in his brief appearance playing dr victor ehrlich from fontanas st elsewhere hes still a vivid character and fits in a hospital setting then you remember didnt st elegius turn out to be an autistic boys fantasy the most useful cameo reflects corporate synergy this movie was made when court tv bought re run rights to the series that network contributed legal waif helen lucaitis who had interviewed the homicide team and later appeared on oz the tv correspondent does an efficient job summarizing the news that is plot points for latecomers although shes so thin that she disappears when she turns sideways lucaitis also adeptly handles a bit of physical comedy with esposito he shows more juice in his scenes with lucaitis than with any of his usual colleagues perhaps those two should have done a spin off as the movie winds down the cream of the cast rises to the top although they are saddled with a loser script andre braugher and kyle secor overcome it their performances remind viewers what made homicide for considerable stretches the best show on the air and one of the best television productions ever its fun to watch top pros do their stuff its just a shame this movie doesnt give them more of a chance die hard fans may want to see this movie anyway but you can live without it',\n",

       " 'the merchant of venice 8 10 this review assumes a basic knowledge of the story and so may be thought of as containing spoilers to anyone unfamiliar with the plot as a film version of the famous shakespeare play merchant of venice does what few adaptations have done since polanskis rather gritty macbeth it takes the spirit of the play and brings it out not just as well as but better than the play alone could readily achieve  lord of the rings director peter jackson has argued that in adapting a book or play there are three options attempt to replicate the original as perfectly as possible use the original idea as an inspiration but take full license for cinematic change or the one he avowedly preferred stick to the original as much as is cinematic ally viable but make such changes as are necessary for the film and while remaining faithful to the intention or spirit of the original in macbeth polanski used the rain sodden beaches and realistic rapes and murder to convey what a bloody and horrific period the play was set in thus bringing to mind the horrific context in which the characters make such ill advised decisions it differs from say branaghs hamlet which achieved new heights of faithful rendition but otherwise offered little new macbeth on the other hand maybe enabled audiences fresh to shakespeare to appreciate some of the dramas fullness without extensive study similarly more familiar audiences might find a greater depth than the unaided stage performance could accomplish such interpretation plays a vital part if audiences are to fully engage not only intellectually but also emotionally with the points shakespeare wanted to make radfords adaptation of merchant of venice does just this it takes crucial moral dilemmas involving religious bigotry or the keeping promises and with minimal messing of the bards holy tome conveys them faithfully within the spirit of the original story the first of these religious bigotry gives meaning to shylocks otherwise outlandish behaviour we see the jews of the period relegated to a walled ghetto only allowed out if wearing an identifying red cap not being allowed to own property one of the few ways they can earn a living is by money lending this makes them both useful to their christian oppressors and at the same time the object of their vilification the idea behind both old and new testament biblical prohibitions against usury probably stems from not making a profit by helping ones friends this is extended by the bigoted christians to curse those they spit on we see shylock not only spit on but fellow jews thrown into the waterways for sport   in an atmosphere that can only be described as threatening the topicality of the film is curious since the bigotry of right wing christianity as personified by bush following americans has turned full circle as they are now the main supporters of zionism and the jewish political leaders bite at their palestinian neighbors much as shylock tries to bite at antonio once he thinks the law gives him the power to do so the psychology is self evident   kick a dog repeatedly and it will become vicious the circle easily continues as the victims of oppression themselves easily lose their sense of moral values and become oppressors the stringent sleight of hand that the disguised portia uses to save antonio has some merit both as a clever interpretation of the unsophisticated law that the venetians of the play so rue and also as a moral pointer shylock may have his pound of flesh according to his contract but may not have any blood an easy analogy could be made as far as warfare and terrorism goes   it is much easier to justify fighting among combatants or attacking ill doers if soldiers or evil doers are the only victims   when there is massive collateral damage as when innocent citizens including women and children are killed in their hundreds the warmongers arguments whether those warmongers be israeli palestinian or us american carry far less popular support  there has long been much argument whether shakespeare was being anti semitic in this story one wonders if he had to adapt the ending for a largely christian audience who had little dealing with jewish people far from teaching him a greater good the ending enforces christianity and humiliation upon shylock   a course likely simply to perpetuate pent up resentment both camps look just as bad   one simply holds more power than the other the slight amelioration of the judgment simply gives the christian judges a better public image or as bassanio so acutely observes when choosing the caskets and solving the riddles to win portias hand in religion what damned error but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text hiding the grossness with fair ornament there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts of course the bigotry applies to organised religion rather than spirituality especially when organised for political purposes but one that easily goads ordinary god fearing people who are not in the habit of splitting hairs the kindness mercy chesed in judaism which is so fundamental to true christianity is something also practiced to a wonderful degree in judaism as in most creeds the jewish faith distinguishes between kindness and charity ways of practicing both effectively and ways of making it part of ones being rather than just an outward show both shylock and antonio are bigoted and use their respective faiths to abuse those of another faith while shakespeare maybe pointed up the chasm between the goodness prescribed by different faiths and its absence in practice the film version reduces much of the window for interpretations of anti semitism and brings a greater degree of realism to the psychological causes the keeping of promises the men to their wives is dealt with less well as are the comic elements inherent in the cross dressing sub plots bassanio however strong his love for antonio are there homosexual elements there cannot make sound moral judgements when showing his gratitude to the judge and so breaks his promise for which portia forgives him displaying a triumphal character for women not only as supremely intelligent and witty but also as more truly merciful and considerate of others than her bigoted male counterparts including her husband some of the acting is a bit stilted and there are too many regional english accents but on the whole merchant of venice delivers a fresh and rewarding reworking of shakespeare i enjoyed the acting and also the very beautiful soundtrack by hayley westenra and others singing ballads penned both by shakespeare and edgar allen poe all in all merchant of venice is a not inconsiderable achievement of british as

       " 'ice the limerick a virus pulled out of the ice just didnt know how to play nice if infected youll kill because you are ill the cure is to be infected twice ice is a great episode one of the greats from season 1 that began shaping the show and if you ask me you really couldnt ask for much better throughout the entire series it starts out with an awesome teaser which in my opinion is really one of the best teasers of the series also a group of scientists in alaska have drilled something out of the ice core which has for some reason caused them to kill each other now mulder and scully are sent with three other scientists to investigate what happened as mulder says this is either because they are brilliant or expendable i take this to mean that they had better be brilliant or else the group soon finds out that the cause of mayhem is a small parasite pulled out of the ice core a little worm that gets into the bloodstream and causes violent behavior since the pilot is infected the rest of the show turns to a suspenseful sort of who done it paranoiac thriller as the others begin to suspect each other of being infected this is not helped at all by an overly paranoid doctor hodge who is un trusting of anyone which we learn early on by the first thing he asks to see everyones credentials to make sure we are who we say we are events lead to finding out the one who is infected and learning how to cure them there are a number of things i like about the episode and of course certain characters that i want to smack in the face from this episode as well as a couple loopholes but most can be attributed to heightened caution and not thinking clearly i like bear from the moment i first meet him its a shame he has to die i also like the scene shown from the other scientists point of view as mulder and scully argue in the other room it gives an interesting twist to our typical perception as a viewer and for me seems to say maybe we shouldnt assume that just because someone is government means they know all sorts of conspiracy secrets as much as hodges frustrates me in this episode i do think that mulder was as much to blame for some of the rash actions taken as any i really like scully in this episode first of all she can tackle like a frickin linebacker second i really like the focus on her terror of what can happen to them out there and how she tries not to let trust and friendship of mulder keep her from biasing her judgment i love the scene when she goes into the room to sleep and first looks as the picture of the previous group all hugging and the birthday presents from them to whoever used to sleep in that room and then how she suddenly freaks out and pushes the dresser in front of the door and in a final touch of subtlety as she sits on the floor with her knees pulled into her chest we see the bottom of a poster on the wall that says bosom buddies this is such great writing a way to say without any words that scully is worried that she may not be able to trust even her very best friend unfortunately this heightened suspicion leads the group to believe mulder to be infected since he discovers murphys dead body even though they havent inspected him at all to find out for sure that was my main problem with the behavior of the characters is they could easily have solved all the suspicion simply by giving blood but i guess i probably would have acted rashly in that situation too but then stupid hodges decides that he has to assume mulder is infected even though mulder willingly surrenders and then is going willingly to be inspected and almost infects mulder in the process luckily he sees that it is really dasilva that is infected and we finally reach a resolution at least as much as you can expect from an x file the government wastes no time in torching the evidence as always happens in these cases and mulder is left with yet another frustrating unsolved case in closing i give ice and easy 10 10 and i leave you with a haiku were not who we are it goes no further than this it ends right here right now',\n",

       " 'simply put i was amazingly disappointed im a huge fan of asian horror and i can watch unoriginality i myself enjoyed the red shoes and phone but this was just poor the movie has a lot of elements that are very high quality the photography is eye catching the visuals are cool the directing is inspired the acting is pretty good the music is easy on the ears and the cgi is incredible but since this is a horror film we are expected to be scared which just wont happen with this film as with most south korean horrors this is unoriginal almost from beginning to end theres the trademark long haired vengeful female ghost ominous clumps of thick black hair and puddles of water and near the end a twist that *almost* but not quite makes sense out of the whole thing the twist is easily one of the best qualities and to the viewers irritation when the film isnt recycling at times so exact that it could easily be dubbed plagiarized imagery from other movies its making you jump a lot and by jumps i dont mean things jumping out or anything just very loud noises and screeches in the soundtrack used to make the audience jump six feet in the air theres even a few made you jump moments that are simply infuriating and when it is not ripping off other movies its boring and hard to sit through and its a shame because ryeong could have easily been really good and it has everything to make it good but its the annoying overuse of completely predictable loud noises and jump scares that eventually ruin the movie a perfect example of how good it could have been theres a moment when one of out characters is looking at a corpse and without a sound the corpse looks back its wholly predictable but the use of silence in that scene is brilliant and unfortunately thats as scary as the movie got for me admittedly ryeong has a few good features and even a couple jumps that arent as predictable and do work theres a very good and sad back story used to explain the events and the twist is pretty unpredictable those are the only things that separate the film from any other asian ghost horror film but the problem with these is even though they do work they have been used before j horror fans will easily realize the big reveal was inspired by a tale of two sisters and it takes the back story a good fifty minutes to get going so in the end ryong really seems like a truly wasted opportunity tae kyeong kim hoped that the plot twist and other good features act as diversions so the audience wont notice the huge flaws but he failed and well we noticed everything my rating 4 10',\n",

       " 'hg wells war of the worlds by director david michael latt is a slightly less than average flick which isnt too bad if one considers the budget he had to work with   only $1 million for this budget the production value wasnt too bad   the best part of it is the visual effects i was thoroughly impressed with the cgi considering the budget and sound design the less then stellar parts of this film are the story which is very prolonged at best but again i think this is because of the budget they had   they had to prolong certain scenes to create the feature length 97 minutes the acting again its because the actors had no story to work with very few exceptional camera shots and the music however again i can let the negative parts go for the most part only because this film was made for a meager budget and still had good production value still you shouldd see it for the sake of seeing how a low budget version of war of the worlds can be made even with flaws 4 out of 10',\n",

       " 'this movie catches a lot of flak but this is usually based on the horrible looking and covered   clothed version of the film that played us television and has also been issued to death on vhs and dvd buy companies like alpha unicorn etc this movie never had a theatrical release in the states although it was picked up by avco embassy in 1973 in spain at the time when there was nudity involved the filmmakers shot two versions one with clothes and one with out the fully uncut english dubbed export print was titled werewolf never sleeps and seems to have been released to home video only in sweden back in the 80s it can be found on ebay and the likes and comes highly recommended my guess is avco cut the film down for a r rated release that never happened in 1974 it was released by avco to television titled fury of the wolfman and the clothed version was used for this tv print cut to 12 years later and fury of the wolfman pops up on home video on the charter label this version appears to be what avco was going to release back in 73 its the uncovered version with some nudity that would never pass on tv or in a pg movie there are several scenes on the charter tape that play out with nudity that are clothed in the tv print  the source for all those dollar duds and vhs editions  but a comparison to the fully uncut wolfman never sleeps reveals that 2 scenes are cut on this version  spoilers in next paragraph  the scene where ilona has waldermar chained to the wall and whips him after he transforms into the werewolf is incomplete after whipping him into submission she starts to remove her clothes and begins making love to the werewolf the werewolf responds positively to these sexual shenanigans too this scene certainly ranks as one of the most unusual in the history of horror films and is a delirious treat its not graphic but the implied bestiality was too much for us audiences or more likely the mpaa ilona is desperately in love with waldemar and could not possess him hence her whole scheme to mind control waldermars wife and involve her in an affair she wanted to wreck his marriage and she accomplishes this while waldemar is in tibet unfortunately he returns a werewolf but this does not slow her down a bit if she cant physically have him as a man she loves him enough to have sex with him as a werewolf this also helps explain the later scene where the werewolf beds down with a woman he spots getting naked before bedtime while peeping through her window this scene is presented sans nudity in the covered version and really makes no sense in the uncut version it would seem ilonas affections have made the werewolf horny and in need of release so he rapes the first woman he can after escaping the other cut is a complete scene of waldemar in bed with karen and she is seen naked a very similar bedroom scene was cut out of the us version of werewolf shadow  werewolf vs the vampire woman  as well the film does have its problems though for certain the director was drunk the bad stand in for the werewolf at points the atrocious english dubbing the inclusion of sequences from the first waldemar film mark of the wolfman aka frankensteins bloody terror and the grotesque overuse of that films music score throughout etc but seen in its original widescreen format and uncut  ie werewolf never sleeps  it is one of the wildest and most outrageous of the daninsky werewolf series with a plot line unmatched in its everything but the kitchen sink approach the cut   clothed pan and scan full screen copies of this film do it no favors and unfortunately thats the version almost everyone commenting on the film have seen the film carries a 1970 copyright and id bet the 1972 release date on the imdb is incorrect the film precedes werewolf shadow  aka werewolf vs the vampire woman  in the series and was certainly released before werewolf shadow the ending of werewolf never sleeps   fury of the wolfman dovetails directly into the opening of werewolf shadow offering concrete evidence of this sadly a complete version of this may never get a decent release a perfect release would be the uncut english version but in spanish with english subtitles the english dubbing severely hurts the movie but any spanish language version would reflect the covered version as shown in spain during the franco era where nudity was verboten',\n",

       " 'the first official release of world wrestling entertainments film division is a pretty basic horror slasher movie called see no evil starring kane one of their big men wrestlers known for having an intimidating presence hard hitting moves and one of the most convoluted backstories in wrestling and lets not pull any punches here while this movie is promoted as the greatest horror movie of all time mostly by wwe it goes without saying that after having seen this movie i can confirm it as one of the greatest comedies of all time see no evil sees a bunch of juvenile delinquents sent to a hotel so they can clean up of course a monstrous murderer played by kane also happens to be living in this hotel and we all know where that goes without giving away too much of the movie plot this film has all the semblance and structure of an early 1980s slasher flick with most of the clichés intact but without any of the scares that those films accompany and thats sort of the main problem with see no evil it tries so many of the tricks implied by its predecessors in the genre that it comes off as predictable veteran horror fans will easily recognize some of the gimmicks ahead of time and even those who have only seen a few flicks should tell what happens next its too generic to be scary the movies gory no doubt but its only there for the effect the dark atmosphere instilled in the movie gives off that feel of terror initially but as you get towards the end it somehow feels out of place and gets tiresome quickly the death scenes dont come off as gory and horrific as much as they do laughable although some of them are pretty inventive and the acting in this movie is pretty bad too as the main characters arent developed enough for us to care when they eventually do get axed some cant even portray fear properly they just scream and cry in a vain effort to emote so when they die it only adds to the comedy because you dont care enough about them that you simply consider them the equivalent of starfleet redshirts to the monster kane as for kane he simply portrayed his movie character the same way he portrays his wrestling character only he uses axes and hooks instead of hellfire and brimstone theres no doubt in my mind that kane can be a great fixture in the horror genre he has the look and presence for it he just needs better material specifically a script that isnt written by someone who writes wrestling shows to work with now despite what may seem like a harsh review i actually enjoyed the film its one of those laughably bad movies that you cant help but sit down and enjoy my main gripe with the film again is that its simply an exercise in filming gory kills and doesnt have any frightening or shock moments i enjoyed it but i enjoyed because it was easy for me to laugh off some of what was supposed to be scary moments in the movie if that happens because it was supposed to be that way the movie would have been rated higher but it didnt it got laughs because its a b movie and it doesnt help that the directors previous experiences was porn flicks and music videos not exactly overcomplicated things to direct anyway nonetheless i enjoyed it tremendously if you dont mind a fun b movie or funny horror film id highly recommend see no evil if you are a true enthusiast of the genre id wait until the dvd comes out before checking it out everyone else should probably go watch something else',\n",

       " 'one of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins one of the most serious examples in 19th century usa of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of gold bearing gravely hills on the sides of the sacramento valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s this process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside causing the material to wash downhill where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment the sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the sacramento river or its tributaries the sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult thus the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by warner first we might ask why warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor technicolor a very rare treatment in 1938 a story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldnt seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time the answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations then we might ask why colorless george brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero to be paired with olivia de havilland among other things this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it even the usually colorful gabby hayes in his small role seemed unusually subdued unfortunately i fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film the portion i saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems it needed to be more like the good earth released just the year before just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man such as errol flynn finally there is the matter of the inane title surely warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title gold or grain is short and to the point incidentally i understand there is still plenty of gold in them thar hills waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining',\n",

capacity to deprave or corrupt many classic books such as lady chatterleys lover fanny hill women in love the story of o or moll flanders have been prosecuted for pornographic content tried by jury and cleared on the basis of this definition but in practice most ordinary citizens are not interested in what they regard as legal equivocation and apply a simpler test that is rather too stringent when applied to books or films which are very close to the line but serves to quickly clear most others from any taint of pornography although the hayes code would have rated aiw as unacceptable both for nudity and for its depictions of sexual activities in practice most people today accept that where the basic message of a book or film is clearly designed to encourage the development of long term stable family relationships in which the participants find real fulfillment it cannot be regarded as pornographic this does not mean that works depicting unsatisfactory or unstable relationships should be recognised as pornographic only that these may need a more sophisticated assessment in aiw we have a film about a young female librarian who has had a rather sheltered upbringing and keeps her suitor at arms length because of a feeling that this is what morality requires her to do after he gets too frustrated by this and threatens to leave her she falls asleep and dreams she is transported to a wonderland closely based on that of lewis carrol where everyone she meets is totally uninhibited about their sexual needs she is shocked but is a kind person who takes things as she finds them so before long she finds her own prejudices gradually melting away she wakes up when her boyfriend returns to break off their affair but her attitude to him has changed so completely that their relationship is fully restored and the film ends with them living happily ever after with their children in a home with a white picket fence and a family dog   an ending clearly directed to those romantics who remain very young at heart pornographic   hardly suitable viewing for children   well probably not quite unless they have very progressive parents r rating   pg would be more appropriate today entertaining for viewers in most age groups    yes but the film has its faults   these are discussed in many of the comments here on imdb however most commentators clearly appreciated and enjoyed it i believe the only pornography associated with this film was the reported claim by an anti pornography activist of scientific proof that a magazine picture of kristin debell was a photographic montage of images of the face of a ten year old with various body parts of adult models these and other comments seriously damaged the career of a very promising young actress but today the film appears to be on its way to becoming a cult classic several home video productions have been released in both vhs and dvd format the last was a dvd containing both the r rated and unrated versions of the film released by subversive cinema in 2007 copies of this were readily available until a few months ago now they are almost exhausted and the mail order vendors who still have copies in stock are selling them at many times their original price   a situation which usually quickly results in a new dvd release appearing this continuing interest nearly 35 years after the original film was released points to near classic status commentators on this database are expected to provide fellow viewers with useful guidance on whether a film is worth watching or even collecting   my comments here were intended to stress the ongoing damage to the industry that still results from pressure on major studios to respect self censorship recommendations originating with the hayes committee on this database such general comments are very quickly marked by readers as not helpful and i seldom make them but fortunately i still have space to add that in my opinion this film is quite unusual and is well worth watching or even buying it is flawed but kristine debell gives a great performance and the film provides a fairly unique and rewarding viewing experience overall i would rate it at 7 stars and will be buying a copy of the next dvd edition if and when it appears if ms debell is still alive today i would love to hear her comments both on the attempts to suppress this film and on the late recognition that it has gradually achieved',\n",
       " 'get ready for it this is one of my favourite films of all time i am relatively unaware of david mamets writer and director other works but after having watched this film half a dozen timesits always a joy to watch i can say without hesitation that he is a genius this film is extremely well written and quickly draws you in to its milieu of deceit con artistry and back room hustles the feel of the film is very similar to the sting 1973 and it also pays homage to film noir its quite a psychologically complex film and will definitely get you thinking about the various plot twists and motives of the shady characters it is slightly predictable at times but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch generally the acting is superb  especially joe mantegna  but someone who i watched the film with remarked to me that its not a good idea to have a heroine lindsay crouse who is not only a gambler a smoker and a thief but also sports a bad 80s hairdo i agree but i think she is nevertheless outstanding in the role the less you know about the plot of this film the better just like mamets most recent film the spanish prisoner because the ending will be even more impressive just sit back and be prepared to be taken for a ride by a movie that comes dangerously close to brilliance',\n",

daughters arrive to be at her bedside ann begins talking about people from her past of whom the daughters are unaware and they question as to whether these lost acquaintances are real or imagined they come to realize that these people from their mothers past are indeed real the story shifts basically between 1953 and circa 2000 with a few glimpses at anns life between those years it was in 1953 that ann met the love of her life and experienced her lifes greatest tragedy one of anns two best friends from college lila is being married anns other best friend is lilas brother buddy lila and buddy are the children of a rich newport family whereas ann is a cabaret singer living in greenwich village who wants to be a free spirit but is still bound by many of those 1950s conventions soon after ann arrives to be maid of honor at lilas wedding she meets the person who will become the pivotal character in the lives of the three   harris he is the adult son of a former servant of the family who grew up with lila and buddy and has gone on to become a physician in a small new england town ann immediately becomes enamored of harris which adds a complication to the fact that lila has always been in love with harris and continues to be buddy also is in love with harris but being 1953 he has redirected that homosexual desire for harris to his good friend ann for he cannot admit to himself that he has a sexual craving for another man buddy exhibits his inner frustration outwardly by being the alcoholic wise cracking bad boy of the family   much to the chagrin of his very proper and uptight parents needless to say all of these expressed and repressed emotions lead to tragedy   after all this is a chick flick in the present time anns daughters have become distant from their mother and are suffering their own life realizations and doubts constance is working to emotional exhaustion trying to keep up her roll as perfect mother and wife nina having always felt inferior cannot maintain a relationship stir all of these relationships into a span of fifty years and you get an intriguing look at society its values and its effects upon the personalities and actions of the complex people involved all of the acting in evening is excellent but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes   along with two unique family relationships   that make this film so very very special claire danes plays the 1950s ann and she does it in a style that clearly shows an intelligent woman of those times who is conflicted by what she is supposed to do as opposed to what she wants to do her performance is not easily forgettable vanessa redgrave plays the dying ann whose mind shifts from the present to the past to flights of fantasy and of course redgrave pulls it all off with sterling style natasha richardson   redgraves real daughter   plays anns daughter constance in the film the scenes between this real life mother and daughter playing fictional mother and daughter are an insightful treat to watch toni collette plays anns other daughter nina nina spends a good deal of her time being depressed and feeling sorry for herself while shutting out a good man who loves her as well as her mother and sister collette is perfect for a part such as this but i have never seen her give a bad or unbelievable performance no matter what part she plays mamie gummer plays 1950s lila and shows us a woman even more conflicted of her expected role in life than her good friend ann she is very good meryl streep   gummers mother   plays present day lila what is there to say about meryl streep other than she always gives an insightful and rewarding performance director lajos koltai states in the dvd extras that he sought out glenn close to play the relatively small part of lilas mother because he felt she was the only actress he could think of to play one scene in the film he certainly was right and closes performance in that one scene etches it in your mind all the other scenes in which close is lilas very proper mother and you get another performance to treasure there are three other scenes in the film combined with the one featuring close described above that make the whole movie worth watching on lilas wedding day ann comes into her room and crawls into to bed with her friend to discuss lilas misforgivings about her upcoming wedding to a man she clearly does not love this scene is repeated fifty years later when lila comes and crawls into bed with her dying friend ann to talk about the lives they have lived in this latter scene streep and redgrave are enthralling the other memorable scene   at least to me   is when buddy declares his love for ann hugh dancy as buddy gives us a heartbreaking performance of a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings his performance is superior chick flick yes a very special film with unbelievable acting directing and scenery definitely i cannot recommend evening too much',\n",

       " 'this is the dreary tale of the self absorbed affair between two unlikable people one of whom is married to someone else it ranks high on my list of most boring movies ever and im a die hard romantic my husband opted out after the first hour of its three by which time little had transpired the desert scenery is spectacular with the endless sand and the sunshine on katharines golden hair however cinematography does not a brilliant film make unless its a national geographic travelogue the magnificent saharan scenery in this ill conceived tale is like putting perfume on a pig the movie revolves around a badly burned dying pilot named count laszlo de almasy who is left in the care of a canadian army nurse hana during world war ii italy he appears to remember little of his life but through a book in his possession his story is very slowly revealed with the help of a man from his past named caravaggio who mysteriously appears at his deathbed almasy was a hungarian cartographer employed by the royal geographical society to chart the sahara desert he entered into an affair with the wife katherine of a fellow explorer who proved to be a british spy meanwhile in the present laszlos nurse has her own affair with a sikh nicknamed kip who is involved in the dangerous work of disarming mines my quarrels with this movie are many length and tedium for starters i dont fault the acting in particular it simply isnt a good story caravaggio seems unnecessary his connection to almasy sketchy he provides a torture scene but appears to serve no essential purpose in the film the core problem is that the two parties of this affair almasy and katharine are woefully unsympathetic characters shallow and dull they simply arent very nice thus there is no one to cheer for almasy is cool aloof haughty and eventually disgustingly possessive of another mans wife katharine is likewise detached and nasty not to mention having a deplorable lack of guilt or feeling whatsoever for her imperfect but loving husbandapart from managing one minuscule tear at the corner of her eye when he dies  this is a tale of lust rather than love with such pearls as i can still taste you almasy ridiculously vocalizes to a colleague his erotic obsession with the indentation in his beloveds neck surely more indicative of a focus on katharines body the victim of this unrepentant adultery is the hapless husband geoffrey who is treated as little more than an unpleasant nuisance its all quite sordid and disgusting katharines charade of feeling faint so that these lovers can indulge in their much vaunted unbridled passion all as silent night is being sung in the background im not sure whether the intent was to contrast the carols purity with their selfish lust but i definitely was not impressed by the sacrilegious undertone we have full frontal nudity with katharine but their sex scenes come across as cold selfish lustful and sometimes downright hatefulnot warm loving giving nor even truly passionate if either of these two feels any emotion for the other it is a totally selfish one and definitely not love as i define the word almasys return to the cave of the swimmers to retrieve the body of his beloved comes across as contrived rather than moving katharine must have expired only moments earlier as she shows excellent colour and barely appears dozing not at all corpse like of course this is all for dramatic effect as the romantics watching this tale normally id be one of them would not appreciate a decaying putrid corpse in order to retrieve his adulterous lovers body he has betrayed his comrades & the allies by giving his maps to the nazis the english being cast as the villains of the piece regardless of whether or not hes keeping his final promise to katharine his traitorous act is not something i admire much  kip seems a pleasant fellow and hana generally likable but their romance is not in the least engaging merely a brief wartime fling with the parties indicating little trauma upon parting moving back and forth between the two settings past sahara desert and present italy proved distracting and unpleasant but really both stories were dull as dishwater the only spark of interest in the whole picture was kips tense mine disarming scene not being totally heartless i did have some sympathy for the current almasys severely burned and dying state however perhaps my major complaint with this film is the euthanasia at the end when hana obliges her patient by giving him a morphine overdose we are supposed to feel that this is justified and morally acceptable because she obviously has affection for almasy cries while she is preparing the deadly syringe and reads aloud from his allegedly passionate herodotus book to console him as hes dying  the amazing director david leans masterpieces should not be insulted by comparison with this pathetic immoral tale yes lawrence of arabia also has a desert but in lean films doctor zhivago brief encounter those engaging in affairs are sympathetic characters exhibiting admirable restraint guilt and some regard for the betrayed spouse as opposed to the total self absorption of this pair in ryans daughter the cuckold husband displays touching loyalty and forgiveness  this movie is a supposedly intellectual enormously over rated bit of boring and disgusting drivel that unfortunately passes itself off as a great love story its best picture oscar does not speak well for the academy for those who wonder why people are so hard on this movie the answer is simple its awful',\n",

      "I've seen the first of the dwarf-Movies and sometimes I had little fun watching it. There are many famous TV/Comedyactors appearing in the first part and presented, in fantasy costumes, typical little episodes of their Stand-Up-Program and exactly that is the problem the second movie has to struggle with. Everything was already there....nothing new to obtain. You're familiar with most of the often boring and dumb \"jokes\" and you always feel like their goal was to put in every Comedylooser of the last decade who wants to get back on stage. There's nothing important about the story: typical fairy-tale story of Rumpelstiltskin, without any importance. I expected something like that but that's nothing I could complain about. I'm actually complaining about the lazy story writers who had an entire background story; their only business was to get many jokes and parodies inside but they didn't get it anyway. This crap is except the great appearance of Helge Schneider a total waste of time and money.(if you don't like him then remove 2 points of my evaluation) If you like to save your money and get bad jokes then watch the crap that's broad casted every Friday evening on SAT1 or RTL for free. I'm sure you will recognize some \"laugthers\" I saw last night in cinema.\n"
